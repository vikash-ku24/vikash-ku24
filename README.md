- 👋 Hi, I’m Vikash Kumar Gupta and I'm a magician who can find hidden insights from your data. You can also call me "Harry Potter" for this.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science because the value of data is increasing day-by-day so how can I let myself behind when the world is moving on.
- 🌱 I’m currently in the process of advancing my knowledge in Python/Django, SQL(MS SQL, Oracle), ETL(Informatica), BI Tools(IBM Cognos, Tableau, Power BI)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects mostly releated with SQL(intermediate to advance level) and BI Tools(on IBM and Tableau)
- 📫 Feel free to contact on vk.gupta1324@gmail.com

Intrested to know more about me:-
I'm using SQL to fetch data and then I crunch the data, use stastical and mathematical tools along with a pinch of Python programming to find not only meaningful insight but also the beautiful insights which were hidden inside tons of GB(s) and few TB(s) of data, by using tools like IBM Cognos Analytics and Tableau I help clients and customers to understand the magic of data.
